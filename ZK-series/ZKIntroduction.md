# "THIS IS THE WAY" OF PRIVACY: INTRODUCTION TO ZERO KNOWLEDGE PROOFS(ZKPs).

### WHY PRIVARY, WHY IS ZERO KNOWLEDGE IMPORTANT??
imagine a world where you are 99.9% sure your can prove a statement is true without revealing the context(who, where, why and what the information is all about) of statement/information. 

To illustructive why privacy and zero knowledge is crucial, consider Alice applying for a of $50k bank loan. In traditional banking, alice must provide all her social security information and history to the bank company and other sensitive data. the problem?,These crucial users data are very eccential and meant to be protected, yet there have been numerous cases on records of client information sold out or breached, breaking trust between customer and institutions. [One Example](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/12/capital-one-pay-190-million-settle-pending-class-action-suit-2019-data-breach). 

Zero Knowlege Proofs system offers a solution. Using ZK technology She could mathematically demonstrate that her income exceeds the minimum threshold, and prove that her credit/Loan score is above the required level, and she has sufficient assets - all without revealing the exact numbers or providing access to her complete financial history.

### WHAT IS ZERO KNOWLEDGE? 
- zero knowledge proof(ZKPs) is  
- properties and elements of zkps
- actors in ZPS: prover and verifier
- types of ZKP systems 
  - STARKS 
  - SNARKS examples are 
    - groth
    - plonk
  -  the Trusted Setup in Zero-Knowledge Proofs: analogy for this, imagine a tresure city where hidden gem boxes are made my hamid, every on this city have access to this boxes, but hamid made duplicate keys for every one in the city to verify themselves, only ligimate keyholder have access. hamid also have a dagerous master key that must not be seen unless other city governor can copy and make their own boxes, we dont want that ahaha 
     -  toxic waste: master key to be destroyed. like tau they can create fake proof that can be used to breach security system 
     -  common reference string: this is like the rules of security verification thhat the prover(villagers) and box(verifiers) use to verify the proof. it is the paramenters or values that has a point in the elliptic curves. 
     -  structured Reference String (SRS): instead of src, where the rules are different and commonly less structured, the src is having precision-engineered rules that fit together in a specific way. the src comes from the ellitic curves derived from the power of tau t
     - Multi-party Computation (MPC): instead of having just hamid making these gem boxes, you have multiple parties/hand smith welding this boxes and ensuring that the toxic waste is passed in well. imagine that all this special welders have they own part of the master key add their own randomness to it.

  - Creating a zero-knowledge proof: steps are: arithemetization, proof creation,verification
    - frontend: constrant system that represent that is use to represent the problem mathematically.
    - backend: is a verifying system that generates and verify proofs based on the circuits
  - Arithemetization: converts mathematical 
  - Domain-specific languages.
