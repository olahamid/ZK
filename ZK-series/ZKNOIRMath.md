## ZK Noir Math: Breaking Down the Cryptography for Web3 Developers

### INTRODUCTION
Many smart contract and web3 developers like myself fear the word "cryptography." Mostly, we learn it on a surface level. It's not that we find math hardâ€”I'm sure loads of devs excelled in math during our university days. I personally enjoy working with numbers, which is why I'm writing this article series.
Well, as a guilty dev that feared cryptography, I decided to change that this year. I'm now more mathematically focused and curious, and I've decided to make "ZK NOIR MATH" a standalone series just to show its importance, verify my knowledge, and help other devs who are scared of diving deep into cryptography to get ready for an amazing journey.
As I am Noir-focused in this series, I will only be explicitly touching on the mathematics that occur around ZK Noir. If you're curious about the math/study around Circom, check out my very good friend's Rareskill bootcamp series.
