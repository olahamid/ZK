## About This Project
This repository documents my journey exploring Zero Knowledge proofs, cryptography, and ZK programming with NOIR. It contains articles, tutorials, explanations, and code examples that progress from basic concepts to advanced implementations.

## Content Areas
- **ZK Series**: Progressive tutorials on zero knowledge(Mostly Noir)
- **ZK Mathematics**: Mathematical foundations of ZKNOIR Mathematics and it's Cryptography.
- **NOIR Programming**: Code examples and projects using the NOIR language

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of cryptography concepts
- Familiarity with programming fundamentals
- NOIR development environment (instructions for setup below)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/olahamid/ZK.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory
```bash
